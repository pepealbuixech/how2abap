# How 2 ABAP
Hey 👋, this repo is about ABAP and the first steps in the language.
Here we will review the data structures, naming conventions (at least in my org 😁) and basics of abap programming.

I'm not an expert and don't work for a big tech were certificates their devs, the code is written as I think is more comfortable and readable by me and my collegues.

If anyone thinks I need to improve some section, let me now.
